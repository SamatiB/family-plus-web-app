      <b>Family+</b> provides a family-friendly service that allows you and your family to find new connections and
      connect with other families. The process is simple. Set up a family profile and choose a family nickname,
      then you're set to use the search page. You can pick any of our categories to search, see info on your results,
      and visit the profiles of families where you can choose to send a connect request.<br><br>
      
      You can find others who share the same interests and also can explore new ones. Currently, you can search
      a selection of hobbies, locations in the USA, languages, days of the week for schedule availability,
      and a list of age ranges.<br><br>

      <b>Who can join?</b>  
      You can be a parent, guardian, relative, family friend, or whoever. We welcome anyone interested in connecting
      and growing their family. With Family+, your son, daughter, niece, nephew, cousin, family friend, or yourself
      can make new friends and have more people in their life that they can call family.<br><br>
